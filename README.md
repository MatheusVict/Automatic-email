# Automatic-email
An application for automatic sending of emails

To use it, you first need to decide whether to use hotmail or gmail.


If you want hotmail, just use your email in the user and the password of the email you want to send, right after, inform the recipient and the sender, the html formatting or just the text and execute

If you want to send it by email, you need to access your google account settings and use the app password generator parameter, if it doesn't appear try activating two-step verification,
and use the generated password instead of your password in the code
